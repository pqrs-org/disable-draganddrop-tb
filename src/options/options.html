            The modifier keys available in the dragstart event are altKey, ctrlKey, metaKey, and shiftKey.
            However, the shift key is preferable for temporarily allowing folder movement for the following reasons:

  	        - On macOS, control+click acts as a right-click, making it unusable for drag operations.
	          - On macOS, folder movement is ignored by Thunderbird when the alt key is pressed.
	          - The metaKey varies between different operating systems, and some environments may not have it.
          -->
          <div>
            Allow the folder movement if drag starts with the shift key pressed.
